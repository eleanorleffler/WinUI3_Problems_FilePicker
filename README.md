# WinUI3_Problems_FilePicker

This repository contains two solutions with sample code demonstrating the FileOpenPicker, FileSavePicker, and FolderPicker in both UWP and WinUI.

All three Pickers in the UWP sample solution work as expected. However, all three Pickers in the WinUI3 Desktop sample solution break and close the application.
